# SomeFrickinMediocreLemons
My personal favorite explication for SFML.

This project is about a yet-unnamed card game.
It is, as the name implies, built using only the SFML and standard c++ library.
To build this, you'll first need to install SFML. 
Just follow the how-to here: www.sfml-dev.org/ \n
CMake is already integrated, to build it simply clone/download the repo and run the following in a terminal:

cd <path-of-project>\n
mkdir Build\n
cd Build\n
cmake ..\n
make\n

This will create an executable called main, which can simply be run using "./main.cpp" in the Build directory.
