# SomeFrickinMediocreLemons
My personal favorite explication for SFML.

This project is about a yet-unnamed card game.
It is, as the name implies, built using only the SFML and standard c++ library.
To build this, you will need SFML. A how-to fore the installation of SFML can be found here: www.sfml-dev.org/  
Since the project ist built with CMake, you might need to install that as well.
To build the project with cmake, simply clone/download the repo and run the following in a terminal:

cd \<path-of-project\>  
mkdir Build  
cd Build  
cmake ..  
make  

This will create an executable called main, which can simply be run using "./main" in the Build directory.
